    <h4 style= color:yellow>1.3-Describing access issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages
        and how we can overcome them.</h4>
    <p style="text-align:center;color:aliceblue">Barriers that people with learning disabilities may encounter on the Web include: lack of alternative modalities for information on Web sites,
        for instance lack of alternative text that can be converted to audio to supplement visuals, or the lack of captions for audio.
        Here ere are some of accessibility issues that users with visual impairments face, which are :
        <h4 style="text-align:center;color:rgb(20, 196, 58)">Layout:</h4>
        <p style="text-align:center;color:rgb(226, 235, 226)">Some screen readers are able to detect and read the CSS of a page.
         However, others rely on the unstyled HTML. This can create issues when the screen reader is determining what should be read first on the page. 
         To avoid this issue, all HTML should be structured in the same way that a printed document would be structured so it makes sense when read left to right, top to bottom.
         <h4 style="text-align:center;color:rgb(24, 184, 45)">Headings</h4>
         <p style="text-align:center;color:rgb(222, 238, 222)">Web users with visual impairments rarely read an entire web page. Instead, they scan the page looking for the parts which interest them most.
          They are also able to scan web pages for pertinent information by using their screen reader to list headings.
          If the headings aren’t used properly (or at all), then the user will not be able to find what he/she is looking for on the page.
          That is why you should never use headings decoratively and should place them in a logically descending manner on the page (H1, H2, H3, etc.).
         <h4 style="text-align:center;color:rgb(26, 175, 21)"><Navigation:</h4>
         <p style="text-align:center;color:rgb(223, 231, 222)"> Screen readers are unable to detect navigation. So, when it is found on a page, a screen reader won’t know to skip over it. This means that users with visual impairments will have to listen to the navigation every time they load a new page.
          A solution to this is to create navigation that can be skipped.
         <h4 style="text-align:center;color:rgb(30, 204, 44)">Non-HTML content</h4>
         <p style="text-align:center;color:aliceblue"> While the use of Flash content is no longer common, it still poses an issue for sites that still support them. 
         Flash is time-based (such as a slideshow), so it is often inaccessible to screen readers. However, Flash can be made accessible to screen readers by making the content self-voicing or natively accessible. The Flash content should also have text cues for the screen reader so the user will be able to decide how to handle that content. Note that there are some cases where it doesn’t make sense to make Flash content accessible to those with visual impairments.
         It often makes more sense to make an alternative version which is more accessible for screen readers.
          <h4 style="text-align:center;color:rgb(22, 218, 80)">JavaScript:</h4>
          <p style="text-align:center;color:aliceblue">JavaScript used to be completely inaccessible to screen readers but now, most screen readers can access it. However, it is important to note that some people may have JavaScript disabled or be in an environment (such as a corporate workplace) where it is turned off. Users may also be using older versions of screen readers that can’t handle JavaScript.
           For this reason, it is important to make sure your website still works without JavaScript.
           <h4 style= color:yellow>1.4-Describing which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h4>
           <p style="text-align:center;color:aliceblue">JPEG
            Joint Photographics Expert Group - otherwise known as a JPEG or JPG are the most popular choice when saving photographs as they are capable of containing over 16 million different colours. 
            They are also a good choice for saving images with complex colour and shading. 
            PNG
            Depending on which PNG you use (either PNG-8 or PNG-24). the more colours you can include. PNG-8s are capable of containing a maximum of 256 colours whereas a PNG-24 can contain an unlimited amount of colours. This means they are not just suitable for images, but also graphics and text. PNGs also give you control over transparency, unlike JPEGs,
             which makes them pretty much perfect for logos. 
             As GIFs can hold both text and transparent backgrounds, they are perfect for creating banners that intend to hold text on top of colours or images. However, as GIFs can’t handle as many colours as a JPEG or PNG, 
             they aren’t suitable for photographs and images with lots of colour and shading.     </p>
