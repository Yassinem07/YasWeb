    <h4 style="text-align: center;color: cornsilk;">Outcome 1    </h4>
    <h4 style= color:yellow>1.1 - Describe the importance of IT in modern business</h4>
 <p style="text-align:center; color:cornsilk"> Information technology plays an important role in today’s business world.
     Majority of the companies rely on this for the purpose of data processing, fast communications and acquiring market intelligence. 
    Information technology helps business improve the processes of business it drives revenue growth, helps them achieve cost efficiency and more importantly,
    ensures they increase revenue growth while maintaining a competitive edge in the market place</p>

 <h4 style= color:yellow>1.2 -Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete a project successfully.</h4>
 <p style="text-align:center;color:cornsilk"> When it comes to complete a successful project, we need to select the appropriate methods and skills for the project,
    to record and track our strategies and plans, using an online Kanban such as Trello for example can help us manage our project tasks ,clearly showing what we have to do and what is done,
    also choose the right machine depends how big our project is,
    Desktop for instance would be great choice if we need to use bigger space to use certain programmes,
    and fast responding to make sure our project runs efficiently ,as well we need to have individual skills that can help us to achieve our goal such as organisation and management skills,
    attention to details and use the right resources and references to look for information that we may need, therefore complete our project successfully.</p>
   
    <h4 style= color:yellow>1.3-Plan and carry out tasks using IT.</4>
    <p style="text-align:center;color:cornsilk">when creating my website project, I will need to ensure that I plan what I want to do in order to execute my list efficiency, for this I will use Trello.
     Trello is a digital Kanban method (to do, doing ,done) which allows me to create a checklist of objectives I have  set for myself in order to complete my website from my ‘About me’ page up,
     until I have finished my project and everything in between.
     I will create the list in the “to do “section of Trello then, individually start each task up until completion whilst I start one objective I will drag and drop it into the doing section until I’m happy with it then move it over into done.
     I will reuse this method of progression up until everything on my “to do “list is dragged over to my done list.
     For further example of how Trello is used and how I have implemented it into my web project here is a link for my Trello board: https://trello.com/b/dy6JW9yB/python-game.
 </p>
    <h4 style= color:yellow>1.4-Describe the risks that might impact digital projects.</h4>
    <p style="text-align:center;color:cornsilk">In terms of the internet, so many digital projects can be impacted in a variety of negative ways, these can be as little as mere obstacles in which can be overcome or as large as the threat of complete failure.
    For example, a server that may be suffering through technical issues can have negative impacts on digital projects. 
    If projects are frequently saved to the cloud after updating them then if a server is struggling to co-operate you can retrieve your data from the cloud, in which it is backed up on.
    However, in the risk of a cyber threat, the software and or hardware you're using could potentially be maliciously manipulated or simply captured in which you can no longer control,
     causing utter corruption to digital projects and many more.
    To avoid the risk of threats such as these, actions can be taken.
    Such as:
    -Enforce quality staff training (if in the workplace)
    -Do not click on unfamiliar links/emails
    -Enforce yourself or other users to create strong passphrases rather than simple passwords
    -Ensure the latest Anti-Virus malware protection is up to date
    -and many more.
    </p>

    <h4 style= color:yellow> 1.5-Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software?</h4>
    <p style="text-align:center;color:cornsilk">When doing anything in terms of tech projects, the understanding of which tools required must be considered. Whether that be hardware and software.
    If I work on the go and travel a lot then a desktop computer wouldn't be appropriate and physically impossible to use under those circumstances, whereas, a laptop, on the other hand - would be effective.
    If I work in an office then it doesn't matter between which system I use as long as the software I have are enabled for correct use.
     For example: the website project I am creating wouldn't matter if I am using a desktop or laptop computer if I was in an office or sat at home,
     but making notes would me something to think about.
    I have use of a mobile phone with Trello bookmarked in one of my tabs for on-the-go thinking and usage of executing note-making. This is useful for me as I can use this whenever I see fit.
    </p>
    

    <h4 style= color:yellow>1.6-Describe and provide analysis on how chosen technologies helped to achieve outcome?
    <p style="text-align:center;color:cornsilk">I have chose  different tools to achieve my result which are Trello and Github ,regarding Trello helped me to manage and organise my thoughts and divided them to three section ‘to do ‘ list and ‘doing ’list and ‘done’ list,
       which you can clearly see your thoughts and tasks moving from one section to another ,rather work on project without knowing where you standing or have you done other tasks or not which will lead to project failure. </p>
 
    <h4 style= color:yellow>1.7-Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h4>
    <p style="text-align:center;color:cornsilk">GDPR is an abbreviation for General Data Protection Regulation and was introduced to recognition on 14.04.2016, although it was adopted on that date, it was enforced into action on 25.05.2018.
    The reason GDPR was enforced is to protect companies and individuals against data theft/fraud and also to harmonize the laws of data privacy across Europe. With GDPR in place, it promotes safety to individuals and companies,
     whilst utilising their rights to not have their data exposed across the web.
     This can be harmful in many ways, which range from little threat to a large threat and can impact not only digital projects massively but also the general public as a whole.
      This is why GDPR is extremely important as it promotes trust into society taking care of their data which would also take into consideration of the knock-on affects that may take place.
      The companies that will not compliance with GDPR will face a fine of£20million or four percent of annual turnover of the financial year ,whichever is greater.

    <h4 style="text-align: center;color:cornsilk"> Outcome 2</h4>
    <h4 style= color:yellow>2.1- Am i happy with tools I have used ?</h4>
    <p style="text-align:center;color:cornsilk">I have chosen few tools to help me build my website and manage my thoughts, 
     using Trello to organise my thoughts ,and used Visual studio code which really helped me to create my simple website using Html language,
      and later on implemented CSS to add more stuff to it .</p>

    <h4 style= color:yellow>2.2-Describing whether the tools selected were appropriate. </h4>
    <p style="text-align:center;color:cornsilk"> in my opinion the tools are selected are appropriate for my project, using laptop and Trello helped me to manage my tasks and can see what’s need doing and what it’s done,
           also using visual studio code which is very convenient to use.</p>

    <h4 style= color:yellow>2.3-Assessing the weakness and strengths of my final Project</h4>
    <p style="text-align:center;color:cornsilk"> At this stage I’m not happy with my website yet as I need to add more stuff though CSS and add more sections,
        so I’m going to add background colours and navigation bar on the top as I’m still missing it, 
        so at the end will look professional and have all the sections and elements needed.</p>

    <h4 style= color:yellow>2.4-Describing further improvement that I can make to my websit</h4>
    <p style="text-align:center;color:cornsilk">I would put further improvement to my website such as make it mobile friendly means that the existing site grows and shrinks with the size of the device it’s displayed on, which is called responsive design,
            also frequently have fresh content on the home page and landing pages,
            people don’t want to see the same thing over and over.</p>

    <h4 style= color:yellow>2.5-Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for the purpose.</h4>
    <p style="text-align:center;color:cornsilk">I have met all the requirements and are fit for the purpose , the multiple web pages is been created and they all linked to each other, as well the relevant  image is inserted,
        however the website still need couple of improvement such as, talk about my work and projects as well make it mobile phone responsive and overall make my website running efficiently with no faults,
        which will make me  to meet all goals that I set for myself on Trello board,
        therefore all project would be successfully complete to the requirements asked for.</p><br>
    <h4 style= color:yellow>3.1-Review of the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and system used.</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center;color:cornsilk">One of the primary advantages of information technology in business lies in its ability to process complex data.
    Over 85 percent of businesses are trying to be data-driven, yet only 27 percent manage to do so.
    Modern IT solutions can help you collect, analyze, process and store data, leading to more efficient operations.
    Banks, for instance, rely on information technology to evaluate the creditworthiness of individuals and companies.
    They also implement advanced IT solutions to streamline credit management, achieve regulatory compliance, detect suspicious transactions and mitigate risks.
    Information technology can also boost your marketing campaigns by providing the data you need to reach your ideal customers.
     Even basic tools like Google Analytics can give you accurate insights about website traffic, bounce rates, sales and other key metrics.
     You can use this data to improve your advertising campaigns or tweak your website so it performs better in search results.
    On the other hand, IT has couple of drawbacks such as,Unemployment :While information technology may have streamlined the business process it has also created job redundancies, downsizing
    and outsourcing. This means that a lot of lower and middle level jobs have been done away with causing more people to
    become unemployed.
     Privacy:Though information technology may have made communication quicker, easier and more convenient, it has also bought
    along privacy issues. From cell phone signal interceptions to email hacking, people are now worried about their once private
    information becoming public knowledge.
    Lack of job security:Industry experts believe that the internet has made job security a big issue as since technology keeps on changing with each
    day. This means that one has to be in a constant learning mode, if he or she wishes for their job to be secure.
    Dominant culture:While information technology may have made the world a global village, it has also contributed to one culture dominating
    another weaker one.</p>
    <h4 style= color:yellow>3.2-ways to improve Productivity and efficiency</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center;color:cornsilk">There are ways to improve Productivity and efficiency,threfore we could reach our objectives that been set for us ,and some are 
    Finish what i start:Leaving a project half completed is just going to make us super stressed.
    How can you move onto the next task knowing that you have an uncompleted one hanging over your head?
    Plan our week in advance: A great to-do list will cut hours of procrastination and confusion about what we should be doing next.
    At the beginning of the week, spend an hour making a detailed list of what we need to accomplish,
     so this way you can choose the most important jobs to complete first so we are not wasting time.
     Also give myself shorter deadline so i can be ahead of the work ,will also give me an advantage of extra time to edit my projetc 
     and do more research to expand my knowledge and add extra information to my work to make stand out and meets the requirements.
     Using the appropriate tools to help me achieve my goals and organise my thoughts for example Trello ,so i can know all is done successful 
     and nothing is been missed.

     <h4 style= color:yellow>3.3-develop solutions to improve own Productivity using IT tools </h4>
     <p style="text-align: center;color:cornsilk">Creating my first project was very intresting for me as well met new learners from different background,
        and we worked as team to create a python text-based python-game
    which was successfully done,i would develp that to work together ina team to create a website and use different IT tools to help us,
    for example we can assign different tasks to each one of us , and that could be done for example each one of us have to creatre a page,
    like unit1 ,unit2,home and project pages,and we can use slack as platform to share data ad files as well codes to help each other 
    when its needed ,and at the last we can all link our pages and come to agree on one style how our website could look using CSS,
    so like working in a team will much easier to do it individually and make sure we all succsses.</p>

    <h4 style= color:yellow>3.4-Describing how  to test digital solutions</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center;color:cornsilk">Testing a digital project is vital before launching to the users, and that could be does
    in different ways such as,testing general webssite and HTML checks as well and we can do that
through diffirrent tools for example W3c markup validation and google webmaster tools as well HTML tidy which is a simple and easy to use online 
tool that allow you to identify any HTML errors you may have on our page.
Second step would involve CSS checking and we can do that trhough CSS compressorAlthough this service cannot check for errors,
 it is a great tool to use after your CSS code is verified. Using this tool, you can shrink your CSS file to help load times on pages that link to it,
 as well as decrease the amount of bandwidth you use.
the next step would be a speed test to make sure the website is not slow and respond fast and we can do that through 
different tools some as webpagetest and pingdom.
Also we would check the accessibiliy,test how accessible our web page in all different web browsers,
also see how our pageappears to those whohave color blindness. Using this page ensures that if someone visiting your site has color blindness,
 won't miss something because your color scheme is bad. 
and at the last make sure our webpage is mobile friendly and it can be accessible from different devices. </p>
