   thank you to take a look at my first webpage,my name is <b>Yassine Mahfoud</b> originally from Morocco
    came to England on December 2014 to london ,and my first job was cleaning the offices in uxbridge which was helpful experince 
    as a first job ,made alot of friends from different background which helped me to improve my English and interacte with them,
    after that i managed to have a second and that was in the restaurant industry with my brother who were a chef at that time 
    so helped me to be kitchen porter with valerie pattiserie in Kingston upon thames ,after a while i start to learn the menu 
    and basic health and safety procedure ,so i became a chef and a team with my brother and cousin in that fast paced kitchen 
    altough with poor management we were doing really well in terms of sales and targets.after   being 12 months in London decided 
    to move to Manchester and work with another company in the same industry which is slug and lettuce,which was great experience 
    and learnt more things and was  great team player.
    At the moment working as production operative in a workplace producing cars parts for different brands ,fast paced environement 
    very important to be a part of team and how we can control the production otherwise will be all piled up and out of our hands 
    which will lead to a mess.
    all in all i do not enjoy working in production industries,rather do what i like and have it as career and develop myself 
    so i decided to take a step into the IT as it's been always my passion and just feel i belong to it ,always interested how things works
    beyond that screen and how that programme really works,rather than just use as a normal user.
    So decided to take the advantage of lockdown and the situation the world is ,and found the training provider <b>Code nation</b>
    which have really this great course which introduced me to Python basics and Html and CSS with no prior knowledge,of course as well the 
    great instructor and the way they break down the course beside the fantastic tutor <b>Jay Fannon</b> who helped me alot to understand most 
    of course.After completing the course i plan to take next level course and take me even in more details to software developement
    and to learn more softare languages,with alot of practice and build a great portfolio ,i should land on my first job in IT world
    with step by step improving myself and work for a great company that value their employees.
    As well im starting level 3 course in marketing (SEO)which is revalant to software developement in case want to put your work online
    and have private projects done for individuals.<br>
