  <p style= "text-align: center; color: white;">We created A text-based game through python
as a team ,which we all had different tasks and roles in it.The game is name Mindgames space which a story based on
board on spaceship and the user need to figure out couple of puzzle and riddles to open all the doors to get to the next level 
and be able to get to the captain,with giving the player multiple choices ,so the game caan take different paths.
we used Trello to organise our thoughts and our ideas ,also we used Slack to exchange our files for example each one of us 
wrote different rooms senerio,we hope can develop it in near future with different tools that can make it run better 
and improved second part.
